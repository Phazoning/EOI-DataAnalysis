#### SMALL SETUP GUIDE

1. With Python installed, create a virtual environment (guide here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)


2. Select the virtual environment and run the following command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
If you're using an UNIX system, attempt using pip3 if you want to install it on the latest Python version
   

3. With this, run the following command "jupyter notebook palmerpenguins.ipynb", which will open the notebook.
Were this to fail, open a python console and run the code step by step following the file "parallel_resources.txt", 
   which is a failsafe
